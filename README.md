# Capitals Quiz 
Capitals Quiz is a Python terminal quiz, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. 

<Here is the live version of the project | link to Heroku>

## How to play 
Users are asked what the capital is of 10 countries and are given a selection of 3 potential answers, listed as A, B and C. One of the answers shall be the capital and therefore the correct answer while the other two options shall be incorrect answers. The other two options however are both cities in that particular country. 

Features: 
The question is asked 
-   If the player selects the correct option, the player is notified of this, is given a score of 1 for that question and then the next question is generated.

-   If the player selects the incorrect option, the player is notified of this, is advised that the score remains as it previously was and the next question is generated.

-   If the player selects anything other than a/A, b/B or c/C, the player is notified that what they have selected is not an option (this includes not selecting anything and just pressing return) and is asked to select A, B or C again until they select a/A, b/B or c/C.

At the end of the quiz
-   The player is given their final score out of 10

## Testing 
I have manually tested this project by doing the following: 
-   Passed the code through a PEP8 linter and confirmed there are no problems
-   Given invalid inputs (including selecting nothing and just pressing return) 
-   Tested in my local terminal and the Code Institute Heroku terminal
